* API updated to force CRL generation and return the CRL

* Added support for Yubi HSM 2 as a key store

* API tokens can now be issued for users, removing the need for applications to login with a username/password

* There is now an option to omit CRL and OCSP AIA extensions in a certificate profile. For example, if the profile is to be used for OCSP signing

* Custom extensions can now be added to certificate profiles

* CAs can now be taken offline, preventing any processing until marked as online again

* Cert issuers can now be configured to allow or deny DN requests

* Cert issuers can now be configured to allow only specific CSR generators

> **Version 1.9.0**
> **Release Date**: 23 February 2023

**Updates**

* For Local CAs - CRL can now be specified as the filename (with CDP and local filename auto updating)
* OCSP server supports other CAs if CRL location is provided
* Now have the option to 'go to issuer cert' for all certificates



**Security Updates**

* None



**Fixes** 

* If you chose to download the issuer of a CA cert you would get the same CA certificate. Now get the correct issuer

> **Version 1.8.0**
> **Release Date**: 21 November 2022

**Updates**

* Windows installer improved. Can now be run as a single PowerShell command
* AD CS Agent updated (now version 1.5) to obtain CA certificates more reliably
* AD users can now login with username, domain\username or username@domain
* Principal Name can now be added as a SAN
* Reverse DN option added to API for Local CAs for cases where the DN in a provided CSR is in reverse
* OCSP server added for local CAs
* P7 data now downloaded in PEM format (previously base64 with no headers)



**Security Updates**

* None



**Fixes** 

* If a certificate had expired it showed a negative value for days to expiry. Now shows expired information correctly

* Local Root CA no longer displays AIA Cert Location, as this was redundant

* Could not uncheck the add as a DNS SAN option

* If a CA was imported the DN encoding between issued certificate and issuer could be different meaning some systems would not build a path. Issuer encoding is now duplicated in the issued certificate

* OK button not enabled until name changed when adding a Microsoft Issuer

**Updates**

* Certificate details now displays: key size (or curve name), thumbprint, policies, AIA and CDPs

* Revoked certificates are now displayed with a red outline

* Credentials cannot be deleted if in use

* When installing, the port can now be specified as well as the listening IP address

* CRLs are now hosted on an http site by default (previously they were https by default)

* Certificate search now retains number of certificates to display

  * User disable and delay added for failed login attempts

  

**Fixes** 

* When Active selected in search - all certificates were returned
* If a CA P12 import password used the 'Â£' character import failed. This was due to encoding in the PowerShell module
* The Certdog service failed to locate the API location on some installations (requiring a workaround) 
* P12 Import occasionally failed when mapping to a Key Store that had non-ASCII passwords 
* Once a Local CA is using a Key Store, the password could still be changed - this is now prevented
* Import Cert for a user (not admin) would produce an unauthorised response
