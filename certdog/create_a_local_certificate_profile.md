# Create a Local Certificate Profile

A certificate profile determines the details that will be included in an issued certificate. Including the certificate lifetime and extensions, such as key usages and enhanced key usages  

A certificate profile is coupled with a *Local CA Configuration* to form a *Certificate Issuer*  

As well as the options set in the profile, the issued certificate will also contain information that is set in the *Local CA Configuration* - including what algorithm will be used to generate the certificate as well as the following extensions:

* AIA (Authority Information Information)
  * This extension contains the locations of the issuer CA certificate and OCSP responders

* CDP (CRL Distribution Points)
  * This extension contains the locations of CRLs

### Creating a Certificate Profile

Select **Local CA** > **Profiles** from the menu and click **Add New Profile**

* Enter a **Profile Name**

* Select the **Lifetime**.  This will be the lifetime of the issued certificate

* If you wish SANs (Subject Alternative Names) that are provided in the CSR (Certificate Signing Request) to be included in any issued certificates, ensure the **Include SANs from CSR** option is checked  

* The **Common Profiles** drop-down contains some common profile types and selecting one of the options will populate the values for *Key Usages*, *Enhanced Key Usages*, *Include OCSP No Check* and *Include Basic Constraints*. You may start with one of these options then alter the settings or leave as *Empty* and manually set all entries

* Select the **Key Usages** - these will be applied to the issued certificate

* Select the **Enhanced Key Usages** - these will be applied to the issued certificate  

* If this is to be an OCSP certificate and you do not wish the status of this certificate to be checked. Set the **Include OCSP No Check** option

* If configured to do so, the CA will include the CDP (CRL Distribution Points) and OCSP AIA (Authority Information Access) URL extensions in every certificate it issues. If you do not want these extensions to be included in certificates issued from this profile, click the **Exclude CDP and OCSP URLs** option. This is often required when issuing OCSP signer certificates.

* Select the **Include Basic Constraints** option if this extension is to be included in the issued certificate

  If this profile will be issuing Sub CA certificates, select the **Is CA** option. This indicates the issued certificate will be a Certificate Authority. For end-entity certificates leave the **Is CA** option as unchecked

  If the *Is CA* option is checked you may also select the **Path Length Constraint**. Select **None** if you do not want to impose any restrictions on the path length (number of CAs below this one in the chain). Otherwise, specify the path length. Note that a Path Length of 0 will mean the issued certificate cannot issue Sub CA certificates below it

* To include policy information in the certificate, click **Policies**:

You may select a policy type of **OID Only**, **User Notice** or **CPS**. Select the required option, populate the required information (OID and either CPS location or User Notice) and click **Add**. You may add further policy entries as required

* To include a custom extension in the certificate, click **Custom Extensions**:

Enter the OID for the extension and the Base64 or ASCII hex encoded data. See [here](creating_custom_extensions.html) for details on how to obtain this data. Click **Set as Critical** if the extension is to be marked as critical and click **Add**. You may add further extensions as required

<br>

When the settings are complete, click **Add**
